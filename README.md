# Dataframe_Exercise-1_and_Exercise-2
Exercise:1
      The data in the "cast" data frame appears to contain information about movies, including columns for title, year, name, type, character, and an "n" column. The formatting in it is a bit messy, and the column names and data were misaligned, along with some missed data. So, by clean up the data or adjusting the code accordingly will make it easier to understand and help us to work with it effectively. By using the Pandas library to read a CSV file for data manipulation and visualization.
Exercise:2 
      The code is designed to load data from a CSV file into a DataFrame and show the initial rows or filtering or sorting of the DataFrame to provide a quick overview of the data. This can be helpful for data exploration and understanding the structure of the dataset. The provided code is written in Python and uses the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
